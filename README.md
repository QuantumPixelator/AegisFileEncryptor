# Aegis File Encryptor

A modern, user-friendly GUI application for encrypting and decrypting files using Fernet symmetric encryption. Built with Python, Tkinter, and ttkthemes for a professional look.

## Features

- **Secure Encryption**: AES-128 encryption with HMAC integrity using the `cryptography` library
- **Any File Type**: Supports encryption/decryption of images, documents, audio, video, and any other file type
- **Themeable Interface**: Multiple built-in themes with persistent theme selection
- **File Selection**: Browse and select files with native dialogs
- **Save Location Control**: Choose where to save encrypted/decrypted files with overwrite protection
- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback on operations
- **Automatic Key Management**: Generates and manages encryption keys securely

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Encryption**:
   - Click "Select File" in the Encryption section
   - Choose any file to encrypt
   - Click "Encrypt & Save"
   - Choose where to save the encrypted `.enc` file

3. **Decryption**:
   - Click "Select Encrypted File" in the Decryption section
   - Choose a `.enc` file
   - Click "Decrypt & Save"
   - Choose where to save the decrypted file

4. **Themes**: Use the dropdown in the top-right to switch themes instantly. Your selection is saved automatically.

## Security Notes

- Uses Fernet (AES-128 + HMAC) for strong, authenticated encryption
- Keys are stored locally in `secret.key` (keep this file secure!)
- **WARNING**: The `secret.key` file generated by the app is for demonstration purposes only and is NOT SECURE for production use. Generate your own keys for real applications.
- Never share encrypted files without the key
- For high-security needs, consider additional measures like key rotation

```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Encryption service not initialized"**: Check file permissions for `secret.key`
- **Large files**: May take time to process; ensure sufficient RAM
- **Theme issues**: Some themes may not display perfectly on all systems
